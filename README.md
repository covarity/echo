# Echo

Extensive networking stimulation and analysis tool. Aim is to enable deeper probing into environments for validation of network performance and connectivity.

## Use Cases

Some example use-cases would be as follows:

* `NetworkPolicy` validation
* Istio Service Mesh policy validation
* Cloud firewall and NACL and ACL rules
* Generating traffic for different protocols including HTTP,gRPC,TCP,UDP et al.

## Roadmap

* Management API for dynamic configuration and generation of networking probe `Task`s
* Headless Browser interactions
* Load generation for range of protocols
